Mjolnir is a web-based network scanner designed to analyze a specific IP address or an entire subnet to gather detailed network information. The scanner performs a range of active and passive reconnaissance techniques to provide insights into the network structure and host behavior. Later it also provides a list of CVEs for that IP which are fetched from The NVD.

## Features

**ICMP Scanning**: Sends multiple ICMP types (Echo, Timestamp, Mask) and interprets various response codes.

**Firewall Detection**: Detects firewall behavior by analyzing responses to TCP and ICMP packets.

**OS Detection**: Estimates the target's operating system using TTL and TCP window size analysis. Since it is a passive fingerprinting technique the exact details of the OS can not be provided.

**Port Scanning**: Classifies ports as open, filtered, or closed for both TCP and UDP services.

**Service Identification**: Maps open ports to common services using standard port-to-service mappings.

**Packet Summary**: Provides a concise summary of the captured packets exchanged during the scan.

**Database Handling**: Caching ensures subsequent scans of the same IP are significantly faster.

**CVE report** : A report of the detected vulnerabilities is generated using NVD API key.

**Web Interface**: Simple, intuitive interface accessible through a browser. No need for command-line tools.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/16aurora/Mjolnir
    cd Mjolnir
    ```

2. Database Setup

-Navigate to the `database` folder

    ```bash
    cd backend/database
    ```

-Run the following command to create the results.db file:

    ```bash
    python db_setup.py
    ```

3. Environment Variables  

- In the project root folder, create a .env file and write this inside the file:

    ```bash
    NVD_API_KEY=your_nvd_api_key_here
    ```

- Make sure you have an activated and valid API key.You can request a free API key from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) here:  
[Request NVD API Key](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key)    


4. Backend Setup

- Navigate to the backend folder

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

- Create and activate a virtual environment

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- Install backend dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Run the backend server

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Frontend Setup

- Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

- Install frontend dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```    

- Start the frontend development server

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
        

## Limitations

- **Restricted IP Scanning**: The scanner may not be able to probe certain IP addresses due to security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or rate-limiting policies that block or filter scan traffic. This is a common limitation shared by even well-known tools like Nmap.

- **OS Fingerprinting Accuracy**: The tool uses passive techniques for OS detection, relying on factors like TTL and TCP window size. As a result, the identified operating system may not be exact, and any inferred vulnerabilities might not accurately reflect the specific version or configuration in use.
